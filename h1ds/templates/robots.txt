# robots.txt for H1DS

# Don't let robots  trawl through data system.  There's  no benefit to
# search engines in  going though the databases, and they  put a heavy
# load on the server.
# Update: 24/4/13 - disallow all,  wouldn't mind having wiki searched,
# robox.txt doesn't  do regex and  we don't  want trawling of  all the
# revisions and diffs etc - too much traffic.
